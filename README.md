# Text-Recognition
Using OpenCV and Tesseract OCR to process a text image to detect the words in the image

Computer don't have the ability to process the videos and images on their own like humans. We can interpret any kind of images to a large extent but the machines lack this ability.

Computer Vision gives them this ability to interpret digital images and videos. Computer Vision is about teaching the computer to see and interpret and process these images for better understanding. Computer Vision is about how computer can gain high level of understanding from digital images.

Field of Use:
<ul>
  <li>Self Driving Cars</li>
  <li>Facial Recognition</li>
  <li>Malicious object detection for security purpose</li>
</ul>  

OpenCV is an open source computer vision library for image processing, Machine Learning. It is a cross platform library.Some of its use cases are:
<ul>
  <li>It includes interfaces for c, C++, Java, and Python</li>
  <li>It is used to process static images</li>
  <li>It is also used to process offline videos and/or streaming videos</li>
</ul>
